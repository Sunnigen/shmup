This is a project to expand on Chapter 9 from the book: Kivy Blueprints by Mark Vasilkov.

• First of all, the game needs a "game over" state, badly. Winning is optional,
but losing is a must; otherwise, it's just not competitive at all, like an
interactive screensaver.
• Another obvious improvement is adding content—diversity is king. More
enemies, more attack patterns, and probably the ability for selected enemies
to shoot back at player. A progressive increase in difficulty level goes in the
same bucket: later stages of the game should bring bigger waves of enemies,
faster spawn times, and so on.
• Adding sound effects is probably the simplest enhancement. Refer to Chapter
7, Writing a Flappy Bird Clone, for details. The same MultiAudio class can be
trivially reused in this project too. Alternatively, take a look at the sample
code accompanying this chapter.
